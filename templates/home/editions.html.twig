                    <p>After a successful experience in Ghana, we were empowered by our mentors and peers at CRI-Paris to continue our educational efforts. Furthermore, we were able to put out together our specializations around the implementation of digital and frugal technologies for sustainable solutions.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, over the course of the 2019-2020 academic year we focused on the development of project-based activities to create a summer school for students with the goal of developing new skills.</p>
